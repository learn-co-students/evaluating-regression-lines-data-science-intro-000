Notice that with each additional data point in our data set, our error will tend to increase.  So with an increased dataset, RSS will increase.  To counteract the effect of RSS increasing with the dataset and not just accuracy, the formula for RMSE divides by the size of the dataset.  So continuing along with our above example:"

    "Before this lesson, we simply assumed that our regression line made good predictions of $y$ for given values of $x$.  In this lesson, we learned a metric that tells us how well our regression line fits our actual data.  To do this, we started looking at the error at a given point, and defined error as the actual value of $y$ minus the expected value of $y$ from our regression line.  Then we were able to determine how well our regression line describes the entire dataset by squaring the errors at each point (to eliminate negative errors), and adding these squared errors.  This is called the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS).  This is our metric for describing how well our regression line fits our data.  Lastly, we learned how the RMSE tells us the \"typical error\" by dividing the square root of the RSS by the number of elements in our dataset."
